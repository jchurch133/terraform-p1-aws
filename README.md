# terraform-p1-aws
My first Terraform project exploring IaC with AWS tasks.

If you wanted to try the script you would need to run these terminal commands to initialize the repository and run the code.

    $ terraform init
    $ terraform apply

Prior to running the script you also need to establish credentials access. I suggest setting up SSO with AWS Config.

I saved my steps in the file "aws_sso_setup_directions.md".
